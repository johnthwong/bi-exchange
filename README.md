# Bilateral Exchange
An agent-based model of a general bilateral exchange problem of *A* agents and *N* goods. This model uses boundedly rational agents, in the sense that the agents do not know the optimal quantities that maximize their utility. Instead, they iteratively make trades that improve their wellbeing, until all trades are exhausted. 

This model can obtain a numerical solution to a general equilibrium problem. This can be helpful as an analytic solution becomes increasingly intractable as *A* and *N* increase.
