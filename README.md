# Bilateral Exchange
An agent-based model of a general bilateral exchange problem of *A* agents and *N* goods. This model uses boundedly rational agents, in the sense that the agents do not know the optimal quantities that maximize their utility. Instead, they iteratively make trades that improve their wellbeing, until all trades are exhausted. 

## Purpose
1. This model shows that a numerical solution to a general equilibrium problem can be obtained. This can be helpful as an analytic solution becomes increasingly intractable as *A* and *N* increase.
2. The exchange process is also decentralized, i.e., it does not need to assume the presence of an [auctioneer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walrasian_auction). This better approximates real-world exchange of products.
3. We show that even when agents do not have full information about prices and others' preferences, equilibrium can still emerge.
